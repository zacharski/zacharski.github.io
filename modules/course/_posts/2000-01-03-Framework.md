## Session Zero: Introducing the Framework

For some background on the project and the development of the framework, we ask that you take a moment to watch this [animated explanation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Byq8c7qHfLKYM2ZUQmhfRTA3eG8) and this video. 

Many libraries and museums have recently established and invested resources into implementing maker programs or makerspaces. These programs and spaces serve a variety of goals, but generally serve as sites of learning. Yet, despite these growing efforts, the field knows little about how to support learning within these spaces. In this course, we introduce a framework to support learning in library and museum makerspaces. This framework suggests how we might create the conditions for learning to unfold within making experiences.

After conducting more than 50 interviews and site visits to library and museum makerspaces across the country, as well as convening a national group of library and museum professionals, the project leaders identified three key elements that create the conditions to support learning in makerspaces:


*Element 1: Purpose*
Libraries and museums implement making programs for myriad reasons. Why and how do making experiences, activities and/or spaces align with and further the goals of a making program and connect to the organization’s overall mission?
 
*Element 2: People*
People play an important role for learning through making in museums and libraries. Educators, librarians, volunteers and guest makers are used in a variety of ways based on a program’s goals. Constraints such as funding and capacity to manage staff are also a factor. What role do people play in managing, monitoring and facilitating learning in a makerspace or program?
 
*Element 3: Pieces And Parts*
Making is a “hands-on” approach to learning and the tools and materials selected should dovetail with the program’s goals and the capacity of the staff. What tools, materials and architecture are central to supporting learning through making in a program and space?

## Why A Framework?
A framework is, in many ways, simply a metaphor. It focuses our attention on important elements of a setting, activity or idea. In this case, the focus is on supporting learning through making. Building a framework serves several goals:
 
*Design:*  The framework provides design considerations for practitioners who seek to develop a new maker program or makerspace. Each of the framework’s three broad categories provides guideposts that can steer the intentional design of the program or space.
 
*Reflection & Professional Development:*  The framework’s three categories serve as reflective points for practitioners currently engaged in this work. In this way, the elements of the framework serve as points to elicit formative feedback, and to create points for conversation amongst stakeholders.
 
*Evaluation:*  The framework can offer a structure for considering the evaluation of maker programs and makerspaces. The framework’s three categories may steer the development of summative measures to evaluate a program or space’s impact.

*Make Every Makerspace Better*
Ultimately, this framework can help guide museum and library professionals who are new to makerspaces or who are just beginning to develop a space. It can help seasoned veterans evaluate their current maker work, too.
 
The elements of the framework are intended to guide practitioners’ planning and implementation of maker-based learning experiences. The framework is not intended to prescribe how to develop and implement those learning experiences. From visiting makerspaces and exploring maker programs across the country, we know that there are many different ways to offer productive maker-based learning experiences. Instead of prescribing a fixed methodology, the goal of the framework is to encourage critical discussions and encourage practitioners to consider critical aspects of design for their individual maker experiences.
 
In the spirit of making, this framework is meant to be flexible and adaptable. It is designed to support the local concerns, priorities and conditions of any museum or library. 

## A Note on Language
This report is peppered with the terms “makerspaces” and “maker programs.” This project defines “making” as building or adapting objects using real tools and real materials and engaging  learners in the process of using these tools and materials. Maker-based learning experiences take place in a wide variety of settings in museums and libraries. Therefore, “maker programs” is used to acknowledge that making can take place with or without a dedicated space. A maker program can encompass the maker activities that are carried out in the conference room of the library, using a mobile cart, working out of a closet or acting as a “pop up” in any corner of a museum or library. 
 
The term “maker” or “making” can be inclusive or exclusive, depending on your perspective. Here, “making” is viewed as an umbrella term that may include programs that refer to themselves as tinkering rather than making, or spaces that refer to themselves as Fab Labs, rather than makerspaces. While some will argue that there are meaningful differences between those terms, we’ve chosen to group these terms together for the purpose of creating the most broadly applicable framework. The field continues to learn a great deal from a variety of hands-on, participatory learning experiences. Our project team asserts that all programs may gain value from embracing the elements of our framework.
