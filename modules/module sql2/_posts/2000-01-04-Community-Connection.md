## Community Connection

*Each session of this course ends with a community connection, where you'll receive a prompt to share something from the activity with the wider virtual community of people working through this course.
There's no set agenda - you can go there to see what others have included, or ask questions and solicit feedback about your own progress.* 

*The community is hosted on Discourse, which means someone will need to create a free account in order to post.<a href="https://discourse.p2pu.org/c/making-learning" target="_blank">You can do that here</a>.

For this first session,<a href="https://discourse.p2pu.org/t/session-1-setting-a-vision-for-making/881" target="_blank">upload what you've completed</a> with your vision statement – either what you’ve written in the tool or your current version of a vision statement. You could also include a video recording of you making your pitch!
