## More SQL

In this module you will learn about normalization including Second and Third Normal Form. You will also learn about transactions. 

After you finish this module you should have a pretty solid understanding of SQL basics. If you have an idea in your head for a cool web application, you should have enough SQL knowledge to implement it in an intelligent way.
