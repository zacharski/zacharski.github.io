#### Install and Elasticsearch and Kibana Docker containers

Check out [installing the ELK stack](https://logz.io/blog/elk-stack-on-docker/)

#### Write and test your first node application:

```
npm init -y
npm install @elastic/elasticsearch
```

The code

```
"use strict";

const { Client } = require("@elastic/elasticsearch");
const client = new Client({
  node: "http://localhost:9200",
  auth: { username: "elastic", password: "changeme" },
});

async function run() {
  // Let's start by indexing some data
  await client.index({
    index: "game-of-thrones",
    body: {
      character: "Ned Stark",
      quote: "Winter is coming.",
    },
  });

  await client.index({
    index: "game-of-thrones",
    body: {
      character: "Daenerys Targaryen",
      quote: "I am the blood of the dragon.",
    },
  });

  await client.index({
    index: "game-of-thrones",
    body: {
      character: "Tyrion Lannister",
      quote: "A mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone.",
    },
  });

  // here we are forcing an index refresh, otherwise we will not
  // get any result in the consequent search
  await client.indices.refresh({ index: "game-of-thrones" });

  // Let's search!
  const { body } = await client.search({
    index: "game-of-thrones",
   body: {
      query: {
        match: { quote: "books" },
      },
    },
  });

  console.log(body.hits.hits);
}

run().catch(console.log);

```

#### load data into Elasticsearch using Kibana

And load it into kabana (http://localhost:5601) The machine learning/visualizing data pane

#### write the backend code

You should be able to write the basic search request using both your previous work and the sample above as a guide. Retrieving a document by id looks like .

```
app.get("/retrieve", async (req, res) => {
  console.log("RETRIEVE ", req.query.id);
  const movie = await client.get({
    index: "movies",
    type: "_doc",
    id: req.query.id,
  });
  res.json(movie);
});
```

#### Test your backend with Postman

Test your code by developing and using a few Postman tests

#### Write the front end

You should be able to repurpose code you already have. A few things to note

My junky-looking result list was generated by

```
<ul>
              {this.state.emails.results.map((show) => (
                <li key={show.id}>
                  <Link href="/p/[id]" as={`/p/${show.id}`}>
                    <a>
                      {show.subject} {show.town} ({show.score})
                    </a>
                  </Link>
                </li>
              ))}
            </ul>
```

You can see that creates a url with `/p/idnumber`. My directory structure looks like this.

![](../../jumpstart/pics/campElastic.png)

Notice that I have a directory p with a Javascript file name [id].js.

That `[id].js` file looks like

```
import Layout from "../../components/MyLayout";
import fetch from "isomorphic-unfetch";

const Post = (props) => (
  <Layout>
    <h1>{props.show.body._source.name}</h1>
    <img src={props.show.body._source.image_url} />
    <h1>{props.show.body._source.closest_town}</h1>

    <p>{props.show.body._source.description}</p>

    <style jsx>{`
      h1,
      h2,
      h3,
      h4,
      a,
      p {
        font-family: "Arial";
        color: #34495e;
        font-size: 20px;
      }

      .text-style {
        margin: auto auto;
        width: 200px;
      }
    `}</style>
  </Layout>
);

Post.getInitialProps = async function (context) {
  const { id } = context.query;
  const res = await fetch(`http://192.168.1.122:8080/retrieve?id=${id}`);
  const show = await res.json();

  console.log(`Fetched show: ${show.name}`);
  console.log(show.body._source);
  return { show };
};

export default Post;

```
